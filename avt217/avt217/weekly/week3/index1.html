Our chef has been busy putting together the perfect menu for the summer months. Stop by to try these appetizers and main courses while the days are still long.</b>

<b>Southwestern napoleons with lump crab -- new item!</b> <p>Layers of light lump crab meat, bean and corn salsa, and our handmade flour tortillas. $7.95</p>

<h2>Main courses</h2>
<b>Shrimp sate kebabs with peanut sauce</b> <p>Skewers of shrimp marinated in lemongrass, garlic, and fish sauce then grilled to perfection. Served with spicy peanut sauce and jasmine rice. $12.95</p>

<br>
<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="20161130">November 30</time>.</p>

<h4>Location: Baker's Corner, Seekonk, MA
