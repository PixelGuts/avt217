		<h4>Navigation</h4>
	<p>The navigation bar at the top of the page is clean, simple, and easy to find. It remains static as you scroll, which is a good design decision for consistent access to navigation options, regardless of where you are on the page. The primary categories like "Things to Do," "Plan Your Trip," and "Events" are clearly labeled and intuitively cover all areas of interest for tourists or potential visitors to Washington, D.C.</p>
		
	<h4>Usability</h4>
	<p>The site is generally easy to navigate, with straightforward paths for both general visitors and those seeking specific information like events, places to eat, or hotels. The site loads relatively quickly, and links to subpages are easy to follow.</p>
	
	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	<p>The website uses clean, modern typography that is easy to read. The font choices are legible across different screen sizes, and the font weights (bold for headlines, regular for body text) establish a clear distinction between primary and secondary information. Some areas of the site, especially on deeper pages, use very dense text (such as long paragraphs or listings). Breaking them up into smaller chunks or using more subheadings could make the content easier to scan and digest.</p>
	
	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	<p>The color palette is generally well-chosen, with subtle tones that donâ€™t distract from the content but still keep the site visually appealing. The use of blue tones aligns well with Washington D.C.'s iconic monuments and waterfront, which reinforces the site's branding. The website could potentially benefit from a more consistent use of micro-interactions or animations, especially when hovering over buttons or navigating between sections. While the design is simple, small interactive details could add a layer of engagement, creating a more dynamic browsing experience.</p>
